3. your comment on WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop

DB  stores the data in docker volume, if the pod is deleted ,data will be lost
After deleted the db pod, result application can't connect to DB.

there was no dependency relationship between the application and DB.


4. your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work.
--Result pod giving result based on image in container.
describe pod
get the mount path
(docker volume)

volume is mounted from the host node.

5. Some jargons (just names are enough- dont need sentences) that you learnt from the  Training session

Containerization
Microservices
Cluster
Pod
replica set
